## Other Things

### SCSS Bundling
`globals.scss` is importing the rest of the scss files from `./bundle.scss`. That file is generated by some scripts in the root directory, and runs whenever a scss file changes. This means whenever you create/remove a scss file inside the styles directory, it will automatically have an import statement generated for it.
